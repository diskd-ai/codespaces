# Changelog

## 2026-07-30

### Changes

- Required an explicit absolute project root for map builds and added custom
  output/map-root query options.
- Added pinned Python dependencies and documented the supported TypeScript and
  safe search-pattern contracts.

### Fixes

- Made `CALLS_API` resolution deterministic by following explicit imports and
  failing closed on ambiguous unqualified providers.
- Rejected colliding module IDs before publication instead of silently
  discarding source files.
- Versioned incremental caches by schema and builder provenance.
- Published cache and map files atomically under a per-project writer lock.
- Rejected malformed maps, unsafe search patterns, and invalid query depths
  with structured diagnostics.
- Preserved source paths containing spaces and recognized TypeScript
  `import = require()` plus literal template imports.
